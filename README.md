It may work even if there are minor version changes. It WILL NOT work with Commons Collections 4.

#Known Issues

Internationalization may not work properly. Or it may. It is untested. 

#Warning

This is the result of a few hours of late night coding. It worked for our purposes, so I am releasing it. Use at your own risk.
